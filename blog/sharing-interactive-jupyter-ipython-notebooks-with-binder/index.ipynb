    "Nikola makes sharing Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks easy. You can render a static page like this and provide a link to download the notebook for interactive usage. However, a major downside with this is that the reader must set up his/her own Python environment which has all the dependencies installed and has to know how to run notebooks. It'd be much simpler if the reader could just click a link and an interactive notebook opened in the browser without him/her needing to do anything else. Well, I just discovered a service which easily enables this: [Binder](http://mybinder.org).\n",

Anyone going to that URL will get a separate isolated environment, so modifying the notebooks won't mess up anything. You can access specific notebooks by appending the path to a notebook to the URL. Simple.\n",

Big thanks for the poor servers anyway, they're doing an amazing job.\n",
