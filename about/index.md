I work as a lead data scientist for [Pandia](http://www.pandia.fi/) on project
[Leanheat](http://leanheat.com/) trying to save the world (or at least Finland)
by making district heating more intelligent.  I did my
[PhD](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/15918) in [Aalto
University](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/jluttine/) on efficient Bayesian
spatio-temporal modelling with a focus on variational Bayesian methods,
state-space models and Gaussian processes.  I have used Python for data analysis
and created a variational Bayesian Python package called
[BayesPy](http://www.bayespy.org/).  I have also co-authored a TikZ library
[BayesNet](https://github.com/jluttine/tikz-bayesnet) for drawing graphical
models in LaTeX.  I write this blog to share my passion for (open) data science.
